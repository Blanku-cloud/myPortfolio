    <div>
      <p>
        In a land far, far away, there exists a land where people's lives are
        filled with martial arts. There are martial arts, whether at school or
        home, surrounding them everywhere they go. Here, martial arts are what
        determines the social standing of a person. The stronger the power of
        their martial art, the more influence they will have. Society looks up
        to the strong and despises the weak.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="my-5">
      <p>
        Here we meet our fantastic protagonist Jay, who is lucky enough to be
        born into a clan known to have created generations of influential
        martial artists. Jay's parents have already planned his whole life, and
        his entire family has high expectations for him after what he is capable
        of at a young age. At the tender age of one, he was strong enough to
        lift a grown man. When he was two years old, he could run as fast as a
        cheetah. When he was three years old, he could swim as freely as a fish.
        Up to age fifteen, his accomplishments were endless. It is found that
        his bone is made up of a unique constitution that allows him to gain a
        body that is perfect for training martial arts.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="my-5">
      <p>
        The overshadowed cousin, Jack, is extremely paranoid, thinking about
        what is so good about Jay. Although he is just a bit worse in martial
        arts than Jay, he is still considered a genius if he is born in another
        clan. Therefore, he made a plan to become the star of the family:
        stealing Jay's bone and replacing it with his own. His first step is to
        challenge Jay to a duel. Before the duel, he would poison Jay's meal,
        pushing Jay to fall into a deep slumber. Then he would sneak into Jay's
        house and kidnap him, bringing Jay to his residence. There he would
        perform the secret sorcery of bone replacement. Finally, he would bring
        Jay back and wait for the duel day. That day, Jack will make fun of
        Jay's trash martial arts talent, and Jay will become a disgrace to the
        clan.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="my-5">
      <p>
        It is exactly a day later when Jay falls into this evil plan. During the
        day, Jack comes across Jay, and this is when he challenges Jay to a
        duel. Jay casually accepts it, thinking this as a friendly spar. After
        this event, Jack sneakily goes into the kitchen and adds sleeping powder
        to Jay's dinner. Then Jack patiently waits for Jay to digest his dinner.
        Then, after his fifth bite of the bread, Jay falls asleep. Jack quickly
        busts into his room and drags him out of his residence into Jack's
        basement.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="my-5">
      <p>
        Here sorcery is performed to forcefully remove the bone, stripping Jay
        from all his talents. While at it, he feeds Jay many different kinds of
        medicine, making sure that he also loses all his previously cultivated
        martial arts power. Then he drags Jay's body back to his residence. All
        Jack has to do now is wait. Jay's glory in the family is coming to an
        end.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="my-5">
      <p>
        A few weeks pass by, and the long-awaited time has come. Many people are
        coming to attend this duel because the number one genius of the clan is
        getting challenged by the number two. The people all want to know how
        much stronger Jay is compared to Jack.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="my-5">
      <p>
        As both people go on stage, people are cheering for Jay. Little did they
        know that Jay was now a cripple as he had no more power left in him
        after Jack's actions. As the match starts, Jack taunts Jay, saying he
        will allow Jay three moves before he starts to attack back. Jay is
        surprised to hear such arrogant words from Jack. Jay quickly sprints
        towards Jack and begins to use his exceptional martial arts technique.
        However, Jack casually dodged the attack, and after three moves, the
        crowd's loud cheering died down. The people are confused, wondering if
        Jay is going easy on Jack. At this point, Jay is getting nervous,
        thinking about why all his attacks are parried off. Jack casually swings
        his arms around, and all of Jay's attacks are fruitless. How could this
        be possible? Where did all the power go? Jay said to himself and is in
        disbelief:
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="my-5">
      <p>
        "Is this all you can do, Jay? Come on, show me more. How did you become
        the pillar of the family when you are this week," Jack said, disdaining.
        In a state of shock, Jay denies all of this, saying there is no way that
        he has suddenly lost all his power or did Jack get this much stronger
        than him, allowing Jack to defend against him this easily. Again and
        again, Jay tries using his martial arts-imbued attacks but to no avail.
        All his attacks are failing. He couldn't make a single starch against
        Jack. Everyone in this match is now starting to think maybe Jay isn't as
        good as he is said to be: a once-in-a-millennium martial arts genius.
        Right now, he seems like a weak nobody.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="my-5">
      <p>
        "Alright, Jay, enough of this nonsense. Let's finish this." Jack
        casually throws some punch toward Jay, quickly knocking him over. Jack
        laughs while kicking him in the stomach over and over again. This is
        just a horrible sight to be seen. He gets closer to Jay and whispers to
        him, "Thanks for your bone." Jay is just staring back in disbelief,
        analyzing what has happened. He tries to find what he means and soon
        finds out what is wrong. His spiritual connection with his bones is
        gone. He feels no power coming from the bone and has lost all his
        martial arts power. However, realizing this now is too late.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="my-5">
      <p>
        This whole mess made the people that support Jay lose hope in him: the
        patriarch of the clan, his friends, and his parents. As the match slowly
        ends, people are quickly dispersed by the clan members. The clan
        couldn't have someone they so publicly praise be trash. Jay has
        tarnished the clan's name, so they announce that Jay is not part of the
        family anymore.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="my-5">
      <p>
        Jay quickly wandered off the streets, feeling disbelief and having
        nowhere to go. Somehow everyone he knows has shut him off after
        realizing that he is not as strong as people say and that he will not
        become the next clan leader. After a long time of contemplation on the
        streets, Jay now understands that the people he surrounds himself with
        are only his friends superficially. They all know that if Jay becomes
        the next clan leader, they will all become very wealthy by using his
        name. They all took advantage of his naiveness and slowly got closer,
        waiting for the day Jay ascended to the head position. However, Jay
        promises he will not become close to anyone because he does not want to
        be used again. He plans to embark on a journey to start preparing for
        his revenge against Jack while training himself to become strong enough
        to destroy Jack and retrieve his bone. His first destination is Fiend
        town.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="my-5">
      <p>
        As he starts his journey across the forest, he hears some rustling
        sound, a person screaming for help. Since Jay is virtuous, he goes to
        the origin of the sound, thinking that someone might be in trouble.
        After charging through a few bushes and vines, he arrives at the spot.
        However, before jumping forward into the action, he hid behind a tree,
        trying to assess the situation. On one side, he saw a girl trembling on
        the ground with her clothes all shredded. On the other side, the
        mountain lion is getting ready to eat her up. However, Jay quickly threw
        a stone at the lion. He is surprised that the lion is still alive but
        remembers that he lost all his strength. The lion quickly turns around
        and jumps onto Jay. He cannot outrun the lion and is now struggling for
        his life as the lion sat on top of him. As the lion goes in for the
        bite, Jay closes his eyes, thinking it is over. In the next second, he
        felt blood all over him. At that instance, the girl called him.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="my-5"><p>"Hey, are you alright?"</p></div>
    <div class="my-5">
      <p>"Hmm" Jay opens his eyes. He is amazed that he is still alive.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="my-5"><p>"Thank you for your help, kind sir."</p></div>
    <div class="my-5">
      <p>
        Jay now feels embarrassed as he thought he would be the one saving the
        girl, but instead, it is the girl that saved him. This is all the fault
        of his cousin. He promised he would pay back tenfold for what Jack had
        done to him. Truly without power, he is like a cripple man.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="my-5">
      <p>The girl asks Jay where he will go, and Jay replies, "Fiend town."</p>
    </div>
    <div class="my-5">
      <p>
        "Oh, me too. Let's go together." the girl said excitedly. "But before
        that, let me introduce myself. I am Angelina."
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="my-5">
      <p>
        After the brief introduction, they set off their way to Fiend town. In
        between, they discover that they have many commonalities and become
        friends quickly.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="my-5">
      <p>
        As they get into the town, an old man latches onto Jay's leg, begging
        him to buy the secret manual that promises to make him very strong. Jay
        tries to buy the book out of pity but also tries to believe that the
        book contains hidden power. To his surprise, he has no money on him. As
        a way to pay him back, Angelina purchased the book for Jay.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="my-5">
      <p>
        After learning that Jay is part of the Tang clan, Angelina wishes to
        follow Jay because there is something she needs to do at the Tang clan.
        After passing through the streets, they found a place to rest. However,
        Jay knows that this inn is no ordinary inn. This place is where his
        grandparents left him a treasured weapon. He came here mainly to
        retrieve this sword. It is said that this sword, if landed on an average
        person, would be able to rival the top martial artist. With this in
        hand, he will be able to defeat Jack easily, surely.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="my-5">
      <p>
        While staying at the inn, Jay starts to read the secret manually, and to
        his surprise, this is a godly manual. By practicing the manual, he will
        be able to build muscles as strong as steel and make his body as light
        as he pleases.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="my-5">
      <p>
        The next day they went to buy supplies and food. As they went across the
        market, someone bumped into Jay. In the next second, Jay knows something
        is wrong and goes to chase that person. Before that person can get away,
        Jay catches him, using what he has learned from the manual. It is found
        that the thief stole his sword, so Jay questioned why the thief tried to
        steal his sword.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="my-5">
      <p>
        The thief introduces himself as Jason and tells Jay that he has a
        personal grudge against Jack. He tries to steal his weapon because Jay
        looks almost like Jack. Jay tells Jason that he must have mistaken him
        for Jack and says he is not Jack but Jay. Jay recruited Jason, knowing
        that he also had a grudge against Jason. Here Jay slowly explains his
        plan and his story to Angelina and Jason. They were shocked and found
        that they should help Jay out. After getting preparations ready, they
        set back to the Tang clan.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="my-5">
      <p>
        In a few days, they finally arrive back at the Tang clan. During the
        journey back, the three people become even closer together because they
        have to face many dangers and problems together.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="my-5">
      <p>
        Jay goes up to the family and tells them what happened. However, the
        elders did not believe him because he had lost all his power. Jay asks
        for a duel against Jack as a last resort, yet his request is denied. Jay
        gets angry that after he loses all his strength, there is no one here
        that would respect him.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="my-5">
      <p>
        However, Angelina and Jason are still there to comfort him. They said
        they would have to sneak in at night and fight Jack.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="my-5">
      <p>
        This is just what they did before Jay got to meet Jack. The members of
        the Tang family find out and try to kick them out. Jack and Angelina
        came together to block them from interfering with Jay. Jack and Angelina
        told Jay he should go and they would hold them back.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="my-5">
      <p>Jay can't thank them enough. He moved quickly and saw Jack.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="my-5">
      <p>
        "Looks like you had quite some fun looking for me. Why are you so
        desperate to search for me?" Jack said.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="my-5"><p>"You should know. Now give it back!"</p></div>
    <div class="my-5">
      <p>
        "Oh. The bone? You think you will get it back," laughed Jack. "What if I
        don't?"
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="my-5"><p>"Then I will take it back with force."</p></div>
    <div class="my-5"><p>"Like you have any power. Hahaha"</p></div>
    <div class="my-5">
      <p>
        Like that, Jay takes out his sword and starts jumping onto Jack. Jack
        blocks the attack but is surprised at how strong the attack is, and he
        wasn't planning to take this fight seriously, but now he has to. Jack
        quickly dodges the attack and answers back with his martial arts.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="my-5">
      <p>
        Because there is still a disparity in strength, Jay is quickly
        overpowered and takes significant injuries.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="my-5">
      <p>
        "Look. You won't be able to do much to me, so scream from this place,"
        said Jack, who only suffered minor injuries.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="my-5">
      <p>
        Jay couldn't accept this and fight back crazily. But one attack after
        another, they all got deflected. In the end, Jay only tired himself out.
        He realized that without strength, there is nothing he can do but slowly
        be eaten up by the strong.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="my-5">
      <p>
        However, before Jack gives the finishing blow to Jay, Jack is stopped by
        Jason. Jason is telling Jay not to give up, but Jay has already lost
        hope. There Jay stands, staring at the sky. Jason tries to get Jay back
        to his senses while fending off Jack, but Jack is too strong. Jason is
        eventually pushed away onto the ground. Jack rushes towards Jay to
        finish him off once again. However, Jason couldn't see his newly made
        friend die in front of him, so he rushed towards Jay to block the
        attack.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="my-5">
      <p>
        Blood splatters everywhere. Jay's entire face is filled with blood, and
        this is where he realizes that he truly has messed up. By giving up so
        early, he had lost Jason. He comes back to his senses and is remorseful
        for his action, but he can't, as he has someone to get rid of first.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="my-5">
      <p>
        Jay is now putting his life on the line. Using everything he has, he
        goes head-on against Jack. As he fights, Jay finds the fight to be
        easier. It is due to Angelina. As soon as she gets here, she tries to
        hinder Jack with her sorcery.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="my-5">
      <p>
        As the fight continues, Jack is slowly losing the battle as he gets more
        tired, and in that one instance, Jack trips on a rock. Jay takes
        advantage of this and does the killing blow. He finishes off Jack but at
        what cost? He lost one of his faithful friends even though he promised
        not to make friends. Jay deeply reflected and found that power and
        revenge are not everything. He found that true friends are what matters.
        They are always there when Jay needs them. They are there when Jay needs
        comfort. If he did not desire power and the power for revenge, Jason
        might still be alive. Jason, Angelina, and he would be able to go on
        exciting adventures together. There is nothing he can do. He once again
        promises himself that after this, he will make more friends who do not
        care about his background. He wants to find people who genuinely care
        about him.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="my-5">
      <p>
        Following this event, Jay is able to get his bones back and regain his
        former self. Everyone in the family starts to respect him again, but he
        knows that friends are more important than anything.
