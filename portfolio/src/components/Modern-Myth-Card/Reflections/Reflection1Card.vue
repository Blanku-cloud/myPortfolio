          The Book of the Dead

        and reading informational text on the Egyptain creation story meet the
        requirement of 1.A. For the Book of the Dead, I was able to understand
        the film and was able to write a reflection on the question. For the
        creation story, I was able to create a presentation from all the reading
        I have done and present it to the class. For 1.B, this was met by
        creating structure in my Book of the Dead writing piece. In the first
        paragraph, I provide the reader with a rough explanation of what death
        is to the Egyptians throughout their dynasty, and this was followed by
        my second paragraph where I explain why death is so important to them.
        Through this, I was able to invoke the curiosity of death in the reader.
        My second paragraph was where most of my persuasion comes in because I
        was able to use concrete evidence from the film to back my point that
        the time of living is used to prepare for achieving immortality: death
        is more important than living. For the presentation, I read the

          target="_blank"
          >Egyptian creation story</a

        from the Canadian Museum of History, which I found to do a good job of
        giving me the big picture of the steps of how the world was created by
        the Egyptians. Therefore, I seek out places like
        <a
          class="text-sky-500 hover:underline"

          target="_blank"
          >Watery Chaos to the cosmic egg</a
        >
        for a more detailed version. Many times before, I have been told that
        Wikipedia is not a good place to get information, but I was never told
        why. I have found out that information from Wikipedia can be easily
        edited; however, I still believe that it should still be a valid place
        to get more information first. Then I can slowly validate each of the
        information that we need by searching it up ourselves. I found that the
        information Wikipedia was trustworthy because the Egyptian Creation
        Story and other information sources were closely aligned with what’s
        said on Wikipedia, meeting the requirement of 1.C. In the Wikipedia
        section under Common Elements, it seems to connect the fact that
        although there were many different versions of the creation story, they
        all seem to have the same beginning, saying that those who write history
        can control history. So during the regime of different dynasties,
        perhaps the rulers would slowly alter the creation story to better
        solidify their rule over Egypt. (1.D) After finishing the videos for the
        Book of the Dead, I still wasn’t exactly sure about what death meant to
        the Egyptians, so I went to look for online sources. I came across this
        one,
        <a
          class="text-sky-500 hover:underline"
          href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://australian.museum/learn/cultures/international-collection/ancient-egyptian/preparation-for-death-in-ancient-egypt/&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1670212865398588&usg=AOvVaw3pojTrkzfpMmN_racPasJv"
          target="_blank"
          >Preparation for death in ancient Egypt</a
        >, which gave a better sense of how important death was to the people of
        Egypt. They were willing to give up their whole life savings to get
        themself mummified even if it meant costing them an actual leg and arm.
        They rather suffer during their time of living, rather than not be able
        to enter the afterlife, which they think is eternal. (1.E) When I think
        about the Egyptian creation story, I usually think about the theory of
        the Big Bang because according to their creation story the world
        initially started as nothing. But then a wave of consciousness awakens
        Nun, which causes a snowball effect of the world's creation, just like
        how the Big Bang exploded into stardust, allowing for more development
        of the world.

        For 4.A, I wrote up multiple drafts of my fairytale and revised it with
        the help of peer review. I have a plan ahead of what I will write and
        how I will write it. After that, I would spend some time rereading my
        story and making necessary changes. For 4.B, I created a structure of
        exposition, rising action, climax, and resolution. In the exposition of
        my fairytale, I was describing what kind of world the protagonist was
        living in, so I can read what is normal in this world. I describe the
        world where the strong live and people admire the strong. I also explain
        where the problem starts arising: the cousin was not happy about how
        strong the protagonist was and stole his power. Then I follow up this
        with a rising story of how he didn’t plan to give up and try to come
        back for revenge. Until he found the strength he needed to challenge his
        cousin. After his death, he regained his former status. Throughout the
        story, I try to express mood through the action of the protagonist, such
        as when the cousin challenges the protagonist into a duel. Because the
        cousin took away the protagonist’s power, the cousin completely
        humiliated him. We can feel a deep hatred and how shameless the cousin
        is: he took away the protagonist's power and dared to make fun of him
        too. 4.C is met because throughout the story there would be a dialogue
        between the characters such as the time the protagonist meets Angella
        and Jack. He would interact with the through dialog. As for 4.D, the
        protagonist slowly realizes for himself that the people he was
        surrounded by are not real friends that he can rely on. When they
        realize that the protagonist becomes weak, they all run away from him.
        They want nothing to do with him. Therefore, he was on a journey for
        revenge against his cousin. However, after his revenge, he found out
        that power is not everything. It is friends that mean everything. The
        protagonist went through character development. For 4.E, although power
        was the recurring motif, I plan the friendship to be the main motif
        because really what is power? With power, you can’t buy real
        friendships, and people are just scared of the strong. This is just like
        money: money can’t buy friendship.

        From my blogs to my creation story, I found that I struggle with what I
        want to write because I just don’t know where to start. I have to sit at
        the table and daydream for a long time before I start writing. Even when
        I start writing, I would be stuck at a certain point. The best approach
        I have developed from this is to go do something else, to keep myself
        busy. Usually, when I come back to the essay later, ideas will just
        slowly come into my mind. It just feels a lot smoother to write.
        Combining all the Greek Mythology stories and articles I have read, I
        found it very interesting. I often find myself to keep reading on
        because it is just fascinating how each story was created to teach us
        something or to explain a special phenomenon.

        Overall, I find the process of explaining all my work fascinating
        because I get to reflect on the major projects and writing I have done.
        It is like keeping a journal and looking back at it. I get to see what
        went wrong and what went right. The more I explain, the more I am
        impressed by my work. I usually don’t appreciate my work because I
        compare myself to others who are better writers than me and smarter. It
        is not often that I stop, slow down and look at what I did. Of course,
        my work is not all that perfect as there will always be imperfections
        here and there.
