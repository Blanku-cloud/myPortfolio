      <p>
        You should really know that I love food. I espically love fired rice
        because that is the first dish I learn to cook. It is easy and cheap to
        make. Hi, I am Michael Chen, a senior at Staten Island Technical High
        School. It just feels werid that I'm a senior already because I don't
        remeber what exactly I did in the past two years. It feels like a fog,
        but here I am. I am now aspiring to major in computer science to become
        a software engineer one day.
